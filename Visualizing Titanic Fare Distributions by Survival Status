# Load the Titanic dataset
titanic = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')  # Load the Titanic data into a DataFrame

# Separate fares based on survival status
Survived = titanic.Fare[titanic.Survived == 1]  # Extract fares for passengers who survived
Dies = titanic.Fare[titanic.Survived == 0]  # Extract fares for passengers who died

# Create overlapping histograms for fares by survival status
plt.hist(Survived, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Survived', color='green')  
# 'bins=30' defines the number of bins in the histogram
# 'alpha=0.5' sets transparency for overlapping
# 'label="Survived"' adds a legend for survivors

plt.hist(Dies, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Died', color='red')  
# Similar parameters for non-survivors, with a different color

# Add labels and legend
plt.xlabel('Fare')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Number of Passengers')  # Label for the y-axis
plt.title('Fare Distribution by Survival Status')  # Plot title
plt.legend()  # Display the legend to distinguish groups

# Show the histogram
plt.show()  # Display the histogram
