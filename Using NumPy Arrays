import numpy as np  # Import the NumPy library for working with arrays.

# Given vectors
vector_1 = np.array([-2, -6, 2, 3])  # Define the first vector as a NumPy array.
vector_2 = np.array([4, 1, -3, 8])   # Define the second vector as a NumPy array.
vector_3 = np.array([5, -7, 9, 0])   # Define the third vector as a NumPy array.

# 1. Combine the three vectors into a 4x3 matrix using np.column_stack()
matrix = np.column_stack((vector_1, vector_2, vector_3))

# Print the resulting matrix to verify its structure.
print("Matrix:\n", matrix)

# 2. Print the shape of the matrix
# The shape attribute shows the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
print("Shape of the matrix:", matrix.shape)

# 3. Print the third column of the matrix using array indexing
# Use slicing to select all rows (:) and the third column (index 2, since indexing starts at 0).
print("Third column of the matrix:", matrix[:, 2])
