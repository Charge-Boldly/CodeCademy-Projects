# Lambda function that returns the ones' place (last digit) of a number
ones_place = lambda num: num % 10

print(ones_place(123))  # Expected output: 3
print(ones_place(4))    # Expected output: 4

# Explanation:
# - `num % 10`: Uses the modulo operator to find the remainder when num is divided by 10.
# - This remainder represents the last digit (ones' place) of the number.
