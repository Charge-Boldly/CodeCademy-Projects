# Load the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame
monthly_report = pd.read_csv('monthly_report.csv')

# Step 1: Print the first five rows of the data to inspect the structure and contents
# The .head() method displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
print(monthly_report.head())

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of visitors (sample size)
# len() is used to count the number of rows in the DataFrame

# Step 3: Calculate the number of visitors who made a purchase
# Use a conditional statement to check for 'y' in the 'purchase' column and sum them
num_purchased = np.sum(monthly_report['purchase'] == 'y')
