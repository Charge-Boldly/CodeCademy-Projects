# Load the dataset
housing = pd.read_csv('housing_sample.csv')  # Reads the data into a DataFrame

# Preview the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure
print(housing.head())  # Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset

# Create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between beds and sqfeet
plt.scatter(x=housing.beds, y=housing.sqfeet, alpha=0.6, color='blue')  
# 'x=housing.beds' sets the number of bedrooms on the x-axis
# 'y=housing.sqfeet' sets the area on the y-axis
# 'alpha=0.6' adds transparency to points for better visualization
# 'color="blue"' specifies the color of the points

# Add labels and title to the plot for clarity
plt.xlabel('Number of Bedrooms')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Area (Square Feet)')  # Label for the y-axis
plt.title('Scatter Plot: Bedrooms vs. Square Footage')  # Title of the scatter plot

# Display the plot
plt.show()  # Renders the scatter plot

# Calculate the covariance matrix for sqfeet and beds
cov_mat_sqfeet_beds = np.cov(housing.sqfeet, housing.beds)  
# np.cov() calculates the covariance matrix between two variables

# Print the covariance matrix
print("Covariance Matrix for sqfeet and beds:")
print(cov_mat_sqfeet_beds)  
# Displays the covariance matrix, which includes variance and covariance values

# Extract the covariance value between sqfeet and beds
cov_sqfeet_beds = cov_mat_sqfeet_beds[0, 1]  
# Accesses the element in the first row and second column of the matrix (covariance)

# Print the extracted covariance value
print("Covariance between sqfeet and beds:")
