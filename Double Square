# Lambda function that returns twice the square of the input number
double_square = lambda num: 2 * (num ** 2)

print(double_square(5))  # Expected output: 50
print(double_square(3))  # Expected output: 18

# Explanation:
# - `num ** 2`: Calculates the square of num (num multiplied by itself).
# - `2 * (num ** 2)`: Multiplies the square by 2 to get twice the square.
