# Defining a lambda function named 'mylambda' that checks the user's age
# If 'age' is 13 or greater, it returns "Welcome to BattleCity!"
# If 'age' is less than 13, it returns "You must be 13 or older"
mylambda = lambda age: "Welcome to BattleCity!" if age >= 13 else "You must be 13 or older"

# Testing 'mylambda' with different age inputs
print(mylambda(15))  # Should print: Welcome to BattleCity!
print(mylambda(12))  # Should print: You must be 13 or older
