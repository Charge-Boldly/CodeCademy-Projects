def get_length(input_string):
    # Define a function named get_length that takes one parameter, input_string

    counter = 0
    # Initialize a variable counter to 0. This will be used to count the characters in the string.

    for char in input_string:
        # Start a for loop that iterates over each character in the input_string

        counter += 1
        # Increment the counter by 1 for each character in the string

    return counter
    # After the loop finishes, return the value of counter, which now holds the total number of characters

# Example usage:
print(get_length("Hello, world!"))  # Output: 13
# Call the get_length function with the string "Hello, world!" and print the result, which should be 13
