# Create a DataFrame named df with provided data.
# Each list represents a row, with data for each month and appointments at four clinics
df = pd.DataFrame([
  ['January', 100, 100, 23, 100],  # Row 1: January data
  ['February', 51, 45, 145, 45],   # Row 2: February data
  ['March', 81, 96, 65, 96],       # Row 3: March data
  ['April', 80, 80, 54, 180],      # Row 4: April data
  ['May', 51, 54, 54, 154],        # Row 5: May data
  ['June', 112, 109, 79, 129]      # Row 6: June data
],
  # Assigning names to columns for easier reference
  columns=['month', 'clinic_east', 'clinic_north', 'clinic_south', 'clinic_west']
)

# Selecting the 'clinic_north' column from df.
# This extracts only the data from the 'clinic_north' column, making clinic_north a Series
clinic_north = df['clinic_north']  # OR we could write df.clinic_north

# Print the clinic_north column data to see the monthly appointments for clinic_north
print(clinic_north)

# Check the data type of clinic_north
# This confirms that clinic_north is a Series, which is a one-dimensional array-like structure in pandas
print(type(clinic_north))

# Check the data type of df
# This confirms that df is a DataFrame, a two-dimensional table-like structure in pandas
print(type(df))
