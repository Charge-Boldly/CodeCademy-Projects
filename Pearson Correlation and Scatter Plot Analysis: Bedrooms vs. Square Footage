# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd  # For handling and analyzing data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For creating visualizations
import codecademylib3  # Codecademy environment library
from scipy.stats import pearsonr  # For calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient

# Load the dataset
housing = pd.read_csv('housing_sample.csv')  # Reads the data into a DataFrame

# Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between sqfeet and beds
corr_sqfeet_beds, p = pearsonr(housing.sqfeet, housing.beds)  
# 'pearsonr()' calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value
# The result is stored in 'corr_sqfeet_beds' (correlation coefficient) and 'p' (p-value)

# Print the Pearson correlation coefficient
print("Pearson correlation coefficient between sqfeet and beds:")
print(corr_sqfeet_beds)  # Displays the strength of the linear association between the two variables

# Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between sqfeet and beds
plt.scatter(x=housing.beds, y=housing.sqfeet, alpha=0.6, color='blue')  
# 'x=housing.beds' sets the number of bedrooms on the x-axis
# 'y=housing.sqfeet' sets the area on the y-axis
# 'alpha=0.6' adds transparency to points for better visualization
# 'color="blue"' specifies the color of the points

# Add labels and title to the scatter plot for clarity
plt.xlabel('Number of Bedrooms')  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('Area (Square Feet)')  # Label for the y-axis
plt.title('Scatter Plot: Bedrooms vs. Square Footage')  # Title of the scatter plot

# Display the scatter plot
plt.show()  # Renders the scatter plot
